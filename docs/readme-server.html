	<h1>GeoNetwork server release notes</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>Welcome to GeoNetwork opensource Spatial Data Catalogue system. The server installation has been developed to allow the full configuration of the base properties of the system during installation. This makes the installation fairly complex, since network details have to be known during the installation process. For desktop installations, please use the desktop specific installer.</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>The server installer will work on all operating systems running Java. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.5 has to be installed first.
	<br/>You can start the installer from the command line/ terminal window using the following command:</p>
	<pre>java -jar geonetwork-intermap-2.1.0_alpha_1-install.jar</pre>
	
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<h3>Java</h3>
	<p>A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.5 Standard Edition (download from <a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com) </a>is required to run GeoNetwork opensource. See the Troubleshooting sections when normal installation or start up fails. </p> 
	<h3>Web server</h3>
	<p>The installer comes with an embedded <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</a> web server. You can use this server for testing. When moving to production you should use <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat" target="_blank">Jakarta Tomcat</a> instead (see post-install notes).</p>
	<p>You can open the GeoNetwork opensource homepage in a web browser by using the following URL http://&lt;your server URL&gt;:&lt;your port&gt;/geonetwork. If you install on your local machine using port 8080 (default), you could use http://localhost:8080/geonetwork</p>	
	
	<h3>Database system </h3>
	<p>GeoNetwork desktop comes with an internal DBMS server, the <a href="http://mckoi.com/database/">McKoi</a> SQL database.<br/>You can use this DBMS for testing but it should not be used for server deployment. If you plan to use another DBMS please select that DBMS during the installation process and make sure that the DBMS is already up and running. Oracle and MySQL are currently supported<br/>You can also configure the DBMS manually at a later stage, although this is more complex (See the community website for details)</p>
