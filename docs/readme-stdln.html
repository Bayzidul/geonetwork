	<h1>GeoNetwork desktop release notes</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>Welcome to GeoNetwork opensource Spatial Data Catalogue system. The desktop installation has been developed to allow a very easy installation, configuration and start up of the GeoNetwork opensource software for use on a Personal Computer. For server installations, please use the server specific installers.</p>
	<p>The installer is configured to run using an embedded database, McKoi and on an embedded web server, Jetty. </p>
	<p>Run the installer and choose to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE 1.5) if none is present on your PC yet. The JRE is provided in the full version of the installer or can be downloaded separately (see Requirements below) . The installer will create a &quot;GeoNetwork desktop&quot; group of shortcuts in the Start menu under Programs. You can start the web server from there and also open the home page of your local GeoNetwork opensource installation from here. </p>
	<p><strong>!!! Very important !!! </strong></p>
	<p><strong>Before you try to open the GeoNetwork desktop homepage</strong> in a browser, make sure you <strong>first start the web server!</strong> You do this by selecting the &quot;Start server&quot; from the start menu. Startup of the server requires a little bit of time (usually less than a minute). You can monitor the web server output by clicking on the &quot;Start server&quot; application icon that appeared in the toolbar. </p>
	<p><strong>To start editing metadata</strong>, log in with the username and password you provided during the installation.</p>
	<p><strong>To stop the server</strong>, use the &quot;Stop server&quot; shortcut in the start menu.</p>
	<p>Advanced features of the system, like metadata harvesting from other nodes, are described in detail on the community web site (see below). </p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<h3>Java</h3>
	<p>A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.5 Standard Edition (download from <a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com) </a>is required to run GeoNetwork opensource. See the Troubleshooting sections when normal installation or start up fails. </p>
	<h3>Web server</h3>
	<p>This installation is configured to run on the embedded <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</a> web server and uses port 8080 by default. You can open the GeoNetwork opensource homepage in a web browser by using the following URL (on the same computer!): <a href="http://localhost:8080/geonetwork" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/geonetwork</a> </p>
	<p>You may wish to change this manually in the Jetty configuration file (by default in c:\Program files\geonetwork_desktop\bin\jetty.xml) and the GeoNetwork opensource configuration file (c:\program files\geonetwork_desktop\web\WEB-INF\config.xml). Also the file ..\bin\win\start-stdln.html will need to be updated. You can open all of these files in a text editor. </p>
	<h3>Database system </h3>
	<p>GeoNetwork desktop comes with an internal DBMS server, the <a href="http://mckoi.com/database/">McKoi</a> SQL database. If you plan  to use another DBMS (like Oracle or MySQL) please install the 
	server version of GeoNetwork opensource and carefully read the documentation. </p>
	<h2>Other operating systems</h2>
	<p> Although primarily created for PCs running Windows, the installer will also work on other operating systems. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.5 has to be installed first. You can start the installer from the command line/ terminal window using the following command:</p>
	<pre>java -jar geonetwork-intermap-2.1.0_alpha_1-stdln.jar</pre>
