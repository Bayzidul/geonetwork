            <para>Using GAST, you can import and export metadata as will. These facilities allow
                you a broad variety of tasks:</para>
            
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Backup of the entire metadata set. Each metadata has its own file with
                        maps and other data files. Once you have the backup, you can decide to
                        import all or only some of them.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Move your metadata from one GeoNetwork’s installation to another. This
                        can be done to mirror your metadata or to upgrade an old installation.
                        In the last case, you export your metadata from your old installation
                        and then reimport them into the new one.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Fill the system with test data. Using the ’skip uuid’ option, you can
                        reimport the same metadata over and over again. This is usefull, for
                        example, if you want to perform stress tests.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>Metadata are exported using the MEF format.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Export</title>
            <para>This facility is located inside the Management node on the left panel and
                allows you to export a set of metadata using the MEF format. Clicking the Export
                node you get its option panel on the right, as you can see from <xref linkend="admin_export_panel"/>.</para>

            <para>Here follows a detailed explanation of the options:</para>
            <para>Output folder This is the target folder in your system where GAST will put the
                exported metadata. You can either press the Browse button to navigate through
                your file system to choose a better location or enter it manually into the
                textfield. Format Here you can specify the metadata’s output format. See the MEF
                specification for more information. Skip UUID Normally is not selected. If you
                select it, you will loose the metadata’s unique identifier (uuid) but you will
                be able to reimport that metadata over and over again. This is usefull to fill
                the system with test data. Search This panel contains some search criteria that
                you can enter when exporting metadata.</para>
            <para>Please notice that the export’s result will depend on the metadata visible to
                the searching user. If you do not authenticate, you will get only public
                metadata.</para>
            <para>Pressing the Export button will start the process. A progress dialog will be
                opened to show the export status.</para>

            <title>Import</title>
            <para>This facility is located inside the Management node on the left panel and
                allows you to import a set of metadata that have been previously exported using
                the export facility described above. Clicking the Import node you get its option
                panel on the right, as you can see from <xref linkend="admin_import_panel"/>.</para>

            <para>Here follows a detailed explanation of the options:</para>
            <para>Input folder This is the source folder in your system that GAST will scan to
                collect metadata to import. GAST will try to import all files with the mef
                extension. Please notice that subfolders are not scanned. You can either press
                the Browse button to navigate through your file system to choose a better
                location or enter it manually into the textfield.</para>
            <para>Pressing the Export button will start the process. A progress dialog will be
                opened to show the import status.</para>

        <section>
            <title>A note on ownership</title>
            <para>Please, consider that the MEF format version 1.0 does not take into account
                user and group ownership. When exporting metadata, you loose this information.
                When importing metadata, the new owner becomes the user that is performing the
                import while the group ownership is set to null.</para>
