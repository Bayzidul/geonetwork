        <section>
            <title>System configuration</title>
            <para>Most of the GeoNetwork system configuration parameters can be changed using the
                web interface. Those parameters that cannot be changed through the web interface can
                usually be changed using the GAST application.</para>
            <para>To get to the System configuration, you must be logged on as administrator first.
                Open the Administration page and select System configuration (<xref
                    linkend="admin_config_where"/>. The link is surrounded with a red rectangle). </para>
            <important>
                <para>New installations of GeoNetwork use <literal>admin</literal> for both username
                    and password. It is important to change this from the Administration page once
                    you logged on!</para>

            <para>Clicking the page’s link you will get the set of parameters that you can change
                (<xref linkend="admin_config_options"/>). Here follows a detailed description of
                them: </para>
            <para>Site General site parameters.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Name</emphasis> The name of the GeoNetwork’s installation. This name
                will be used to identify the node in operations like the harvesting.</para>
            <para><emphasis>organization</emphasis> The organization the node belongs to. Just for
                informative reasons.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Server</emphasis> Here you have to enter the address of your
                GeoNetwork’s node. This address is important because it will be used to access the
                node. </para>
            <para><emphasis>Host</emphasis> The node’s address or IP number. If your node is
                publicly accessible from the Internet, you have to use the machine’s domain/address.
                If your node is hidden into your private network and you have a firewall or web
                server that redirects incoming calls to the node, you have to enter the public
                address of the firewall or web server. A typical configuration is to have an Apache
                web server on address A that is publicly accessible and redirects the requests to a
                Tomcat server on a private address B. In this case you have to enter A in the host
                parameter.</para>
            <para><emphasis>port</emphasis> The node’s port (usually 80 or 8080). If the node is
                hidden, you have to enter the port on the public firewall or web server.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Intranet</emphasis> A common need for an organization is to discriminate
                between internal anonymous users (users that access the node from within the
                organization) and external ones (users from the Internet). Node’s administrators can
                specify different privileges for internal and external anonymous users and, in order
                to do so, they have to specify the parameters of the internal network. </para>
            <para><emphasis>Network</emphasis> The internal network’s address in IP form.</para>
            <para><emphasis>netmask</emphasis> The network’s mask.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Z39.50</emphasis> GeoNetwork can act as a Z39.50 server, which is an OGC
                communication protocol to query and retrieve metadata. </para>
            <para><emphasis>Enable</emphasis> Check this option to start the Z39.50 submodule.
                Please, notice that GeoNetwork must be restarted in order to make this change
                active.</para>
            <para><emphasis>port</emphasis> This is the port on which GeoNetwork will be listening
                for incoming Z39.50 requests. Usually, the value of 2100 is a standard one, but to
                have multiple GeoNetwork nodes on the same machine you have to change this value in
                order to avoid port conflicts between the different nodes.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Proxy</emphasis> In some occasions (like harvesting) GeoNetwork must be
                able to connect to remote sites and this may be denied if an organization uses proxy
                servers. In this cases, GeoNetwork must be configured to use the proxy server in
                order to route outgoing requests. </para>
            <para><emphasis>Host</emphasis> The proxy’s name or address to use (usually an IP
                address).</para>
            <para><emphasis>port</emphasis> The proxy’s port to use.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Feedback</emphasis> GeoNetwork can provide some feedback to the
                administrator if some events happen, for example a metadata is downloaded or some
                feedback is provided using the online form. You have to configure GeoNetwork with
                proper parameters to send an email. </para>
            <para><emphasis>Email</emphasis> This is the email address that will be used to send
                feedback to the administrator.</para>
            <para><emphasis>SMTP host</emphasis> Organization’s mail server to use when sending
                emails</para>
            <para><emphasis>SMTP port</emphasis> Mail server’s SMTP port (usually 25). </para>

            <para>At the bottom of the page there are some buttons with the following purpose: </para>
            <para>Back Simply returns to the main administration page. Save Saves the current
                options. If some options are invalid, the system will show a dialog with the wrong
                parameter and will focus its textfield on the page. Once the configuration is saved
                a success dialog will be shown. Refresh This button simply refreshes the displayed
                options taking the new values from the server. This can be usefull if some options
                get changed dynamically (for example by another user). </para>

            <para>Public host and port usage </para>
            <para>Up to now, the server’s host and port are used in these cases: </para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>During an editing session, when adding data links to a metadata. The host
                        and port will be used to build download links to store inside the metadata.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>During CSW requests. The GetCapabilities operation returns an XML document
                        with HTTP links to the CSW services. These links are dynamically built using
                        the host and port values.</para>
