About this Project
------------------

This document provides guidelines to install, configure, use and customise the GeoNetwork opensource software. 

The GeoNetwork project started out as a Spatial Data Catalogue System for the `Food and Agriculture organisation of the United Nations (FAO) <http://www.fao.org>`_, the `United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) <http://vam.wfp.org>`_ and the `United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) <http://www.unep.org>`_.

At present the project is widely used as the basis of Spatial Data Infrastructures all around the world. 

The project is part of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) and can be found at `GeoNetwork opensource <http://geonetwork-opensource.org>`_.
