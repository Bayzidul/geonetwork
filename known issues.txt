List of bugs, issues to be resolved & todo list

Bugs:
- XML Metadata insert form requires a template "title" even for regular metadata. 
  Without a title the import fails.
	Proposed resolution: title field is not displayed when Metadata is selected in the 
	drop down. In Insert.java the title parameter will be validated depending on the 
	isTemplate parameter.
-	XML Metadata insert using ISO19139 only works when the gmd: prefix is used for 
  ISO19115 elements. The current import conversion from 19115 to 19139 does not 
  create output that includes these prefixes. The related XSLTs need updating.
	
Issues:
- A big issue is the backward compatibility of the harvesting. v2.1 does not harvest
  nodes of v2.0. This can not be. Even if less optimal harvesting, this should remain 
  possible when upgrading.

- Sample metadata does not have:
	- thumbnails
	- online resources (requires InterMap integration too)
	- code list issues with ISO19139 metadata
	
- The Back button's behavior in the administration services should be verified as at 
  least a number of them should bring the user back to the administration page and 
  not back into the editing forms for instance. User and Group management are among 
  these.

- The Check for ISO19139 fails.

- General error handling seems to be missing. Raw Java errors are displayed in case 
  of a session time out for instance
  
To do:
- in metadata.show.xsl & search-results.xsl the href does not point to baseURL yet of
  the resource yet.
  
- Revisit the help.xml, links.xml and about.xml to verify and update (a.o. links & 
  some of the translations))
 
- Further improve help through the use of DHTML tooltips and AJAX request to server
 
- Integrated version with InterMap opensource

- Set logging options to OFF before creating final release
